# forthtalk
forthtalk.py: A Python shell for communicating with AVR (e.g Arduino) Forth based systems via serial communications.

Primarily developed to work with flashforth (Mikael Nordman) but some features should work with other AVR Forth's over serial communications with a few tweaks. Developed on Linux, so may need modifying for other OS's and only used so far with Arduino (ATmega328P). Inspired by amforth-shell.py (Keith Amidon) and ff-shell.py (Mikael Nordman), but pretty much written from the ground up.

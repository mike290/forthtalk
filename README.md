forthtalk.py: A Python shell for communicating with AVR (e.g Arduino) Forth based systems via serial communications.

A Python shell for communicating with AVR (e.g Arduino) Forth based systems via serial communications. Primarily developed to work with flashforth (Mikael Nordman) but some features should work with other AVR Forth's over serial communications with a few tweaks. Developed for Python 3.4.3 on Linux, so may need modifying for other OS's and only used so far with Arduino (ATmega328P).
